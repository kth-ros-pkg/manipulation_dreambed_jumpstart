# Manipulation Dreambed Jumpstart

## What is the dreambed about?

It is a software suite for grasping planning, validation, and execution. 
It was developed by Joshua Haustein, PhD student at the Robotics Perception and Learning Laboratory, KTH, in the context of the European Project RobDREAM.


## What can I find in this repository?
This repository is aimed to provide access to all the documentation and docker scripts for setting up the manipulation dreambed on your computer.

We particularly recommend using *ROS Indigo Igloo and Ubuntu 14.04 64bits*.


## Next steps
We suggest that you clone this repo, and then check our [Wiki](https://github.com/kth-ros-pkg/manipulation_dreambed_jumpstart/wiki), in which you'll find plenty of information on how to setup your environment for running the dreambed.
